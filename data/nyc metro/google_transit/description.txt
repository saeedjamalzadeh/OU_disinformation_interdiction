Dear Kash,
 
These two items should both be contained in the GTFS zip folder available at this link. The zip folder contains a transfers.txt file, which lists all connected stations including their walking times in seconds. Moreover, it contains a stops.txt file, which lists all stops in the network including the latitude and longitude coordinates.
 
I hope this helps.
 
Best regards,
Steffen
